      <h2>Steve Gant</h2>
      <img src="./img/Steven_Gant_profile_photo.jpg">
      <p>My name is Steve Gant. Before deciding to attend Code Fellows and make a career change to Software Development,
        I worked for a HVAC wholesaler as a counter sales rep and an assistant manager.
        I decided to make the career change because I felt I was at a bit of a dead end with my previous employer. There
        were few opportunities for growth.
        I chose Software Development primarily because most jobs in the field offer flexibility, which would allow me to
        spend more time with my family.
        Ideally, I would like to work for a larger company to start, but eventually, I would like to freelance from home
        or on the road.
        In my previous job I trained a lot of people - shared my knowledge. I love to share what I know.</p>

      <p>Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an
        information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support. Since then, I have recently
        completed a computer science degree at Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to specialize
        in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is something I
        want to pursue.</p>
