      <img>
      <p>Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support. Since then, I have recently completed a computer science degree at Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to specialize in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is something I want to pursue.</p>
