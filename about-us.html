          <h2>Steve Gant</h2>
          <p>My name is Steve Gant. Before deciding to attend Code Fellows and make a career change to Software
            Development,
            I worked for a HVAC wholesaler as a counter sales rep and an assistant manager.
            I decided to make the career change because I felt I was at a bit of a dead end with my previous employer.
            There
            were few opportunities for growth.
            I chose Software Development primarily because most jobs in the field offer flexibility, which would allow
            me
            to
            spend more time with my family.
            Ideally, I would like to work for a larger company to start, but eventually, I would like to freelance from
            home
            or on the road.
            In my previous job I trained a lot of people - shared my knowledge. I love to share what I know.</p>

          <h2>Marco Villafana</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an
            information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support. Since then, I have
            recently
            completed a computer science degree at Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to
            specialize
            in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is
            something I
            want to pursue.</p>
